# Prowlarr

TRAWL implements the FlareSolverr v2 API exactly, including the `version: "2.0.0"` field that Prowlarr validates. No plugins or code changes required — it's a URL swap.

## Setup

1. Open Prowlarr and go to **Settings → Indexers**
2. Scroll to the **FlareSolverr** section
3. Set the URL to your TRAWL API address:

   ```
   http://localhost:8191
   ```

   If running via Docker Compose on the same host as Prowlarr:
   ```
   http://trawl:8191
   ```

4. Leave all other fields at their defaults
5. Click **Test** — you should see a green tick
6. Click **Save**

## Verification

After saving, trigger a search on any Cloudflare-protected indexer. TRAWL will handle the challenge transparently. Subsequent searches to the same indexer domain return from cache in ~500ms.

## Prowlarr inside Docker

If Prowlarr runs inside Docker on the same host, use the Docker network name instead of `localhost`:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml (your Prowlarr stack)
services:
  prowlarr:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/prowlarr:latest
    environment:
      - FLARESOLVERR_URL=http://trawl:8191
    networks:
      - trawl_default  # join TRAWL's network

networks:
  trawl_default:
    external: true
```

Or use the host's IP address directly:

```
http://host.docker.internal:8191  # Mac/Windows Docker Desktop
http://172.17.0.1:8191            # Linux Docker default bridge
```

## Troubleshooting

**Test fails with "connection refused"**  
The API container isn't running or the port is wrong. Run `docker compose logs api` and check the port mapping with `docker compose ps`.

**Test succeeds but searches still fail**  
Some indexers use a different domain than their main site. TRAWL caches cookies per hostname — the first request to each subdomain takes the full challenge time.

**`version` mismatch error in Prowlarr logs**  
This should not happen — TRAWL always returns `"version": "2.0.0"`. If you see it, check you're not running an old build with a cached layer: `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`.
