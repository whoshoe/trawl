# Browser Pool

The browser pool is the core performance differentiator over FlareSolverr and Byparr. Instead of launching a new browser process per request (3–5 seconds each), TRAWL keeps N instances always running and ready to accept work.

## Design

```typescript
interface PoolEntry {
  id: number
  browser: Browser         // Camoufox browser instance
  context: BrowserContext  // single persistent context per browser
  busy: boolean
  lastDomain?: string      // hostname of the last request served
  lastUsedAt?: number      // unix timestamp
  restartCount: number
  healthy: boolean
  temporaryContextUses: number
  restartReason?: string
}
```

Each entry is a `{ browser, context }` pair. `Camoufox({...})` creates the browser; `browser.newContext()` creates an in-memory cookie context. Cookies accumulate across page navigations within one context, which helps CF managed-mode challenges resolve faster. Pages are closed on release to free memory.

## Acquisition

`pool.acquire(domain)` uses sticky routing:

1. Look for an idle browser whose `lastDomain === domain` — reuse it (its context may already have warm CF cookies)
2. Fall back to any idle browser
3. If all browsers are busy, poll every `pollIntervalMs` (default **100ms**) for up to `acquireTimeoutMs` (default **15000ms** = 15s)
4. Throw `PoolExhaustedError` after `acquireTimeoutMs` with no idle browser

The domain match is on the **hostname only** — `https://example.com/page1` and `https://example.com/page2` both match `example.com`.

Both thresholds are configurable via the `BrowserPool` constructor:

```typescript
new BrowserPool({
  poolSize: 3,                // BROWSER_POOL_SIZE (default 3)
  acquireTimeoutMs: 15000,    // BROWSER_ACQUIRE_TIMEOUT_MS — 15s default
  pollIntervalMs: 100,        // how often to re-check for an idle browser
  recycleAfterTemporaryContexts: 8,
  contentProcesses: 2,         // BROWSER_CONTENT_PROCESSES — caps Firefox content procs
})
```

When `acquireTimeoutMs` elapses, the API surfaces the rejection as **HTTP 429** with a FlareSolverr v2 error envelope — both on `/v1` (Prowlarr/Jackett) and on `/scrape` (native). See the [API reference](/api-reference/overview#error-responses).

## Release

`pool.release(id)` marks the browser idle and closes all open pages. `lastDomain` is updated to the domain just served. Cookies are kept to speed up the next request to the same domain.

Tier 3 and Tier 4 create short-lived isolated contexts for fresh challenge solves and proxy escalation. Those contexts are closed by the tier code, but long-running Firefox/Camoufox processes can still retain child content processes after repeated solves. Two complementary defenses bound this growth:

1. **`contentProcesses` (default `2`)** caps Firefox content processes per browser at launch via the `dom.ipc.processCount` Firefox pref. This is the primary defense — bounds thread/RAM growth at the source regardless of context churn.
2. **`recycleAfterTemporaryContexts` (default `8`)** is now **recycle-on-suspect**: the orchestrator only flags a browser for recycle when Tier 3/Tier 4 returns `blocked` / `needs-js`. Successful solves preserve cookies, `cf_clearance`, and warm fingerprint state. Set `BROWSER_RECYCLE_AFTER_CONTEXTS=0` to disable this recycling.

See issue #13 (original bug), #17 (recycle-on-suspect trade-off discussion), and the [configuration docs](/getting-started/configuration#browser_recycle_after_contexts) for tuning.

## Self-healing

A health check runs every 30 seconds:

```typescript
for (const entry of this.entries) {
  if (entry.busy) continue
  const connected = entry.browser?.isConnected() ?? false
  if (!connected) await this.restartEntry(entry)
}
```

`browser.isConnected()` is a synchronous check. A disconnected browser is relaunched in place. `restartCount` increments so you can monitor via `/health`.

## Why Camoufox Firefox, not Chromium?

Cloudflare detects datacenter Chromium via multiple signals: the CDP leak (`Runtime.enable` fires in a detectable pattern), `navigator.webdriver`, missing browser internals, and fingerprint inconsistencies.

Camoufox patches Firefox at the C++/Juggler level — fingerprint data (fonts, canvas, WebGL, screen resolution, locale) is spoofed before any JavaScript runs. CF's detection scripts see a real Firefox profile. This is harder to counter than JS-level patches because the data originates from native code, not overridden JS properties.

```typescript
import { Camoufox } from 'camoufox-js'

const browser = await Camoufox({
  headless: true,
  geoip: true,
  humanize: true,
})
```

## Memory usage

Each Camoufox instance uses ~350–500 MB. With the default pool of 3:

| Pool size | RAM usage (browser only) |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| 1 | ~400 MB |
| 3 | ~1.2 GB |
| 5 | ~2 GB |
| 8 | ~3.2 GB |

The API service sets `shm_size: 1gb` in Docker Compose. Firefox uses `/dev/shm` heavily; without enough shared memory, tabs crash silently.
